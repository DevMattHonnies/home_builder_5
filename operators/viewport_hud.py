"""Persistent GPU-drawn control HUD for the 3D viewport.

When the `use_viewport_hud` addon preference is enabled, draws controls
along the top of every 3D viewport: a left-anchored scene-navigator
trigger (just past the toolbar; it moves into the centered row when the
viewport's overlay text occupies that corner), a centered
selection-mode picker for the active product library, and a
right-anchored strip of Blender's own viewport controls -- box select,
move, rotate and View All -- beside the navigation gizmo.
A permanent draw handler renders the strip; addon keymap entries route
clicks and hover moves on widget rects to their actions while passing
every other event through. No persistent modal operator is used --
Blender skips autosave while ANY modal operator is running, so the old
always-on listener silently disabled autosave for the whole session.

Widgets are intentionally thin -- they read and write the per-product
selection-mode properties, which already own their update callbacks, so
the HUD contributes presentation and hit-testing only, never selection
logic.

    Label flips Enable -> Disable while the matching modal runs; on_click
    either invokes the operator (Enable path) or asks the running modal
    to commit and exit via request_exit_active_modal (Disable path).
    Width is sized to the longer of the two labels so the button
    geometry doesn't jitter when state changes.

    Pass a `glyph` to draw it as a square icon instead. A toggle that
    rides in the selection-mode row has to earn its width there, and a
    state you leave on is a mark, not a sentence -- the same reasoning
    the Grab pill follows. The Enable / Disable wording is not lost: it
