"""Closet drawer box system selection.

One scene-level dropdown picks the drawer box system for every closet
drawer:

- Wood Box: standard sizes - depth steps 9/12/15/18/21" with the
  depth left behind the front and height steps in 1" increments with
  the clear opening the front covers, dropping back to the parametric
  size when the opening is smaller than the smallest standard.
- Metabox: standard side heights N/54, M/86, K/118, H/150 mm (minimum
  openings 78/110/142/174) and slide lengths 270-550 mm.
- Avantech (+ Illumination): standard box heights 101/139/187/251 mm
  (each needs opening >= height + 5 mm) and the same slide lengths;
  Illumination additionally reserves 12.7 mm of depth for the battery
  pack.
- None: no boxes are built (fronts only).

Every system takes its height from the clear opening the drawer front
covers, and its depth from what is behind that front, which is how the
prior library sized a box.

The drawer layout sizes each box to its system's standards, applies the
system material, and records the resolved selection on the box
(hb_drawer_box_type / hb_drawer_box_size) so downstream consumers can
read it. Where an opening leaves too little room for even the smallest
standard the box is built at that smallest size so there is something
that fits, and box_warning() gives the reason in the words the prior
library used for it.
