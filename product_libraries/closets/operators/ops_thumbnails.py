"""Batch thumbnail rendering for the closet library.

Maintenance operator, not part of the end-user flow. For each catalog
product it builds the real thing in a throwaway scene, renders a
preview into closet_thumbnails/, then tears the scene down. The
resulting PNGs are committed to the repo so users get them shipped.

The renderer itself is the one the face frame library already uses -
same camera, same framing, same 540px output - so the two grids cannot
drift into looking like different products.

Three kinds of product need three ways of building:

- A STARTER resolves through the name dispatch and builds itself.
- A LOOSE part is cut at a size and stands on its own, so it is built
  bare, the way it arrives on the cursor.
- A FITTED part only exists inside an opening, so it is built into one
  and the whole run is what gets framed. On its own a fixed shelf is a
  rectangle indistinguishable from the loose shelf beside it in the
  grid; in an opening it reads as what it is.

Existing renders are left alone unless `overwrite` is set: geometry
changes are what this is for, and a run to fill in a new product
should not quietly restyle the ones already shipped.
