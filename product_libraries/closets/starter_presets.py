"""Declarative closet starter catalog.

One entry per library item. The class name resolves through
types_closets.CLOSET_NAME_DISPATCH; per-type geometry defaults live as
class attributes on the starter classes (face_frame pattern). This module
stays import-light (no bpy) so the solver/types can be smoke-reloaded.
